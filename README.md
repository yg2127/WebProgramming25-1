✅ Team Member Branching Guide (main → personal branch)

1️⃣ Clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/yg2127/DL_study.git
cd DL_study

2️⃣ Switch to the main branch and make sure it’s up-to-date:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

3️⃣ Create your personal branch and push it to GitHub:

git checkout -b yourname   # e.g., minji
git push -u origin yourname

	•	-b creates a new branch
	•	-u sets the upstream branch (tracks the remote branch)

⸻

🧠 Collaboration Tips
	•	Do not push directly to main! → Only merge via Pull Requests (PR)
	•	After completing your work, open a PR (Pull Request) on GitHub
	•	To avoid conflicts, always pull from main before starting your work:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main   # or rebase if preferred

🧩 Git Concepts Summary
	•	pull = Fetches changes from a remote branch and merges them into your current local branch
(Only affects main unless you’re on a different branch; your changes on your branch are safe)
	•	fetch = Downloads changes from the remote repository without modifying your local branches
	•	merge = Combines changes from one branch into your current branch
	•	fetch + merge = pull!
	•	commit = Saves changes to the local repository (a version snapshot)
	•	push = Uploads your committed changes to the remote repository
	•	branch = A separate line of development; allows multiple people to work on different features/files independently
