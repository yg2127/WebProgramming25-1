‚úÖ Team Member Branching Guide (main ‚Üí personal branch)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/yg2127/DL_study.git
cd DL_study

2Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to the main branch and make sure it‚Äôs up-to-date:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create your personal branch and push it to GitHub:

git checkout -b yourname   # e.g., minji
git push -u origin yourname

	‚Ä¢	-b creates a new branch
	‚Ä¢	-u sets the upstream branch (tracks the remote branch)

üß† Collaboration Tips
	‚Ä¢	Do not push directly to main! ‚Üí Only merge via Pull Requests (PR)
	‚Ä¢	After completing your work, open a PR (Pull Request) on GitHub
	‚Ä¢	To avoid conflicts, always pull from main before starting your work:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main   # or rebase if preferred

üß© Git Concepts Summary
	‚Ä¢	pull = Fetches changes from a remote branch and merges them into your current local branch
(Only affects main unless you‚Äôre on a different branch; your changes on your branch are safe)
	‚Ä¢	fetch = Downloads changes from the remote repository without modifying your local branches
	‚Ä¢	merge = Combines changes from one branch into your current branch
	‚Ä¢	fetch + merge = pull!
	‚Ä¢	commit = Saves changes to the local repository (a version snapshot)
	‚Ä¢	push = Uploads your committed changes to the remote repository
	‚Ä¢	branch = A separate line of development; allows multiple people to work on different features/files independently
