### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yg2127/DL_study.git  
cd DL_study

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to `main` and update it

git checkout main  
git pull origin main

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create and push your personal branch

git checkout -b yourname   # e.g., minji  
git push -u origin yourname

## üß† Collaboration Tips

- ‚ùå **Do NOT push directly to `main`**
- ‚úÖ Use **Pull Requests (PRs)** to merge changes into `main`
- üîÑ Before starting any work, **always sync with the latest `main`** to avoid conflicts:

git checkout main  
git pull origin main  
git checkout your-branch  
git merge main   # or use rebase if preferred
